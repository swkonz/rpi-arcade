## Contributions
This project uses material from the Stanford CS 107E course repository found [here](https://github.com/cs107e/cs107e.github.io). The code used in the libpi and libpiextra libraries are not mine, and were written by the CS 107E course staff over the years. Specific contributions can be found in the header files available on the course repo. Additionally, the code for the "Flap-pi Bird" (popularly known as "Flappy Bird") was written as a part of a joint final project for the CS 107E class between Claire Huang, Matthew Tan, and Sean Konz. The project has been heavily adapted from it's initial version.
